		Meet me, <span class="font-bold text-yellow-400">Roopesh Patel</span>, aka Roopsbee, aka Roops, a curious
		individual on a quest to explore the world of software development and beyond. With a strong background in
		front-end web development, I'm currently honing those skills full-time with Next.js and<span
			class="font-bold text-blue-400"
		>
			TypeScript</span
		>, while constantly exploring new ways to improve myself. Whether that's from changing my editor from vscode to
		<span class="font-bold text-green-400">Neovim</span>, or jumping from windows and mac to Linux.
	</p><p class="mb-4">
		My interests extend far beyond just one language or framework - I'm also invested in exploring new technologies
		and currently experimenting with the excellent language<span class="font-bold text-red-400"> Rust</span>.
	</p><p class="mb-4">
		As a software developer, my ultimate goal is to work on projects that make a positive impact the world. I often
		ask myself, <span class="font-bold text-yellow-400"> if i'm not helping, what am I doing?</span>
	</p>
	<p class="mb-4">
		In short, I'm a passionate, curious, and driven individual who loves nothing more than exploring the vast and
		exciting world around me, one line of code, one thought, one idea at a time.
	</p>
	<p class="mb-4">
		Of course there is <span class="font-bold text-orange-400">more to life than just code.</span> I dabble in martial
		arts, go on the occasional hike, ride slow at extreme speed on my bike, and pretend to be a professional chess player
		when I can find a game.
		<span class="font-bold text-yellow-400">Get in touch</span> if any of that stikes a chord. I'm extremely modest and
		love to chat.
